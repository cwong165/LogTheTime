# Time Logger

Time Logger is a simple Python script that allows users to log the current time and add a short comment. The logs are saved in JSON files, with each file containing up to 10 logs. The file name includes the date it was first created. If you exit and re-enter the program, it will continue logging in the unfinished JSON file.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Save the script as `time_logger.py`.
3. Run the script from the terminal using the following command:

```
python3 time_logger.py
```

4. Follow the prompts to log the current time and input a short comment.

## Upcoming Features

In a future update, this project will be transformed into an iOS app with a graphical user interface (GUI). Users will be able to log time and comments using a simple and intuitive interface on their iOS devices.

Stay tuned for updates and improvements to the Time Logger project!
